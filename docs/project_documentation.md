## Theming

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The following themes are available:

- Cyber
- Sunset
- Forest
- Ocean
- Neon
- Pastel
- Monochrome

You can customize the theme by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file. To apply a theme, you would typically update the main layout file or a component that wraps your application to include the specific theme classes. For example, to use the 'cyber' theme, you might add classes like `bg-cyber-dark text-cyber-light` to your `<body>` tag or a main `<div>`.

Each theme provides a set of colors that you can use throughout your application. Refer to the `tailwind.config.js` file for the specific color definitions for each theme.
